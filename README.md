# source-openrc

This script will read the openrc file with your cloud credentials and place
them in your enviroment variables. If you don't provide any file it will
assume you are using CloudVPS and ask for a project, username and password.

# Usage
If you have an rc file you can source it like this:

    Source-OpenRC.ps1 C:\your-openrc.sh

It is also possible to start the script without arguments and pass the project 
name or ID, username and password manually.
